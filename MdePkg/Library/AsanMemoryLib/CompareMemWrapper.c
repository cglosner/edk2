/**
  Compares the contents of two buffers.

  This function compares Length bytes of SourceBuffer to Length bytes of DestinationBuffer.
  If all Length bytes of the two buffers are identical, then 0 is returned.  Otherwise, the
  value returned is the first mismatched byte in SourceBuffer subtracted from the first
  mismatched byte in DestinationBuffer.

  If Length > 0 and DestinationBuffer is NULL, then ASSERT().
  If Length > 0 and SourceBuffer is NULL, then ASSERT().
  If Length is greater than (MAX_ADDRESS - DestinationBuffer + 1), then ASSERT().
  If Length is greater than (MAX_ADDRESS - SourceBuffer + 1), then ASSERT().

  @param  DestinationBuffer A pointer to the destination buffer to compare.
  @param  SourceBuffer      A pointer to the source buffer to compare.
  @param  Length            The number of bytes to compare.

  @return 0                 All Length bytes of the two buffers are identical.
  @retval Non-zero          The first mismatched byte in SourceBuffer subtracted from the first
                            mismatched byte in DestinationBuffer.
